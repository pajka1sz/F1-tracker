# 🏎️ F1 tracker
API for following current and previous F1 seasons' results. 
## About the project
I created a Python API for getting data about the latest F1 races' results and overall season standings using **FastAPI** and **REST** as well as **Bootstrap** for front-end. It would not be possible without two APIs I used for gathering the data, which are as follows:
* [F1 API](https://github.com/Rafacv23/F1-api) - used for gathering race results and overall standings,
* [Open F1](https://github.com/br-g/openf1) - used for gathering weather conditions data.

The API allows you to:
* gather the results of the latest F1 race as well as weather conditions and previous editions' winners 🏁
* gather the results of any F1 race you want (in the same format as above) 📊
* get overall drivers standings of current F1 season 🏆
* get overall drivers standings of any season you want 📜

## Roadmap
- [x] API integration
- [x] Race data
- [X] Seasons' standings
- [x] Weather conditions data
- [ ] Manufacturers standings
- [ ] Next race preview with weather forecast

My goal is to create an artificial intelligence model for predicting the next race results.
